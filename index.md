## About

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) in 2014.
Later, I received my Master's in structural engineering from the University of Pécs in 2017 (Hungary).
In 2018, I moved to Switzerland to pursue my Ph.D. at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).
I conducted my research at the Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics (EESD) laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Katrin Beyer from 2018 to 2022.
After that, I worked for a brief period as a postdoctoral fellow at EESD (4 months).
After I was awarded the prestigious PostDoc.Mobility grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), I moved to the USA to join the van Rees laboratory (led by Prof. Wim van Rees).
