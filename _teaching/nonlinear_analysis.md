From 2019-2022, I participated in preparing and lecturing this master course at EPFL. With Prof. Katrin Beyer (EPFL), I worked on preparing multiple advanced topics, such as, nonlinear materials, multi-point constraints (MPC), and geometric nonlinearity. For three consecutive years, I was involved in preparing lectures and codes, as well as designing exams and correcting them.
