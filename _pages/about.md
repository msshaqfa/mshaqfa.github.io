# Welcome

## About

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) in 2014.
Later, I received my Master's in Structural Engineering from the University of PÃ©cs in 2017 (Hungary).
In 2018, I moved to Switzerland to pursue my Ph.D. at Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), conducting research at the Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics (EESD) Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Katrin Beyer from 2018 to 2022.

After that, I briefly worked as a postdoctoral fellow at EESD for 4 months.
In 2023, after being awarded the prestigious PostDoc.Mobility grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), I moved to the USA to join the van Rees Laboratory (led by Prof. Wim van Rees at MIT).

Currently, I work with Prof. Josip AtaliÄ‡ as a senior scientist at the Croatian Centre for Earthquake Engineering at the University of Zagreb (UniZg).

## Research Works and Interests

During my academic career, I developed an interest in a variety of topics, all of which converge around geometry, shapes, topology, and optimization problemsâ€”often with an engineering flavor. These areas demand in-depth knowledge of numerical methods such as Galerkin approaches, Discrete Exterior Calculus, and spectral methods.

**Keywords**: Solid Mechnanics, Fractal surfaces, Morphology, Computational geometry, Metaheuristics, Optimization, Fracture mechanics, Masonry structures, Rough contacts, CAD.

### Manifold harmonics (MH)
This ongoing work focuses on surface parametrization, with further results and details to be presented in due course.

### Spheroidal harmonics (SOH)
This is from our new paper [1] that generalizes the traditional **spherical** harmonics approach (SH).

### Remeshing microstructures of 2D contours

Remeshing of closed contours to generate and parameterize 2D microstructures. In the Figure below, the first two rows show how the contours morph from low to high frequencies (k) and how the number of segment (s) affects the reconstruction; the contours were expanded with a maximum 2<sup>7</sup> harmonics. The last row shows the corresponding FEM mesh for different frequencies and segments to control the mesh refinements.
