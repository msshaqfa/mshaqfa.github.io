## About

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) in 2014.
Later, I received my Master's in Structural Engineering from the University of PÃ©cs in 2017 (Hungary).
In 2018, I moved to Switzerland to pursue my Ph.D. at Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), conducting research at the Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics (EESD) Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Katrin Beyer from 2018 to 2022.

After that, I briefly worked as a postdoctoral fellow at EESD for 4 months.
In 2023, after being awarded the prestigious PostDoc.Mobility grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), I moved to the USA to join the van Rees Laboratory (led by Prof. Wim van Rees at MIT).

Currently, I work with Prof. Josip AtaliÄ‡ as a senior scientist at the Croatian Centre for Earthquake Engineering at the University of Zagreb (UniZg).

## Research Works and Interests

During my academic career, I developed an interest in a variety of topics, all of which converge around geometry, shapes, topology, and optimization problemsâ€”often with an engineering flavor. These areas demand in-depth knowledge of numerical methods such as Galerkin approaches, Discrete Exterior Calculus, and spectral methods.
